0x0B. Python - Input/Output

Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):You must use the with statement
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:Prototype: def write_file(filename="", text=""):Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist; Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added:Prototype: def append_write(filename="", text=""):If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):Prototype: def to_json_string(my_obj):
Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:Prototype: def from_json_string(my_str)
Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation:Prototype: def save_to_json_file(my_obj, filename)
Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”:Prototype: def load_from_json_file(filename)
Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:You must use your function save_to_json_file from 5-save_to_json_file.py; You must use your function load_from_json_file from 6-load_from_json_file.py; The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json
Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object:Prototype: def class_to_json(obj), obj is an instance of a Class, All attributes of the obj Class are serializable: list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean
Write a class Student that defines a student by:Public instance attributes:first_name,last_name,age; Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age); Public method def to_json(self): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py)
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py): Public instance attributes:first_name,last_name,age; Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):If attrs is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list must be retrieved, Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py):Public method def reload_from_json(self, json): that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:You can assume json will always be a dictionary,A dictionary key will be the public attribute name,A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:Returns an empty list if n <= 0, You can assume n will be always an integer
Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string:Prototype: def append_after(filename="", search_string="", new_string=""):
Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>,Each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), prints those statistics since the beginning:Total file size: File size: <total size>,where is the sum of all previous (see input format above),Number of lines by status code:possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500,if a status code doesn’t appear, don’t print anything for this status code,format: <status code>: <number>,status codes should be printed in ascending order
