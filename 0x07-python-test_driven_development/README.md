0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Write a function that adds 2 integers.Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98), a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer, a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float, Returns an integer: the addition of a and b.
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div).
Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name="")
Write a function that prints a square with the character #.Prototype: def print_square(size)
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and:, Prototype: def text_indentation(text)
Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[])
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices:Prototype: def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module NumPy, Prototype: def lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
